        <h2>Trip to Hogwarts..</h2>
        <p class="p2">
            Eleven-year-old Harry, with a scar-shaped lightning bolt and nervous excitement, boarded the Hogwarts train. He met funny Ron and brainy Hermione, making instant friends. The magical Hogwarts castle, hidden in mist, sorted Harry into brave Gryffindor house. Days flew by – learning spells, brewing potions, and practicing duels. But trouble brewed too! They faced a scary three-headed dog, a smelly troll, and even a giant chess game, protecting a secret treasure from evil Voldemort. Friendship and bravery helped them win, ready for more adventures. Home at last, magic school awaited, and Harry, the boy who lived, wasn't done yet! He dreamt peacefully in his Gryffindor dorm, unaware of the whispers echoing through the castle halls: "He's back. The Dark Lord has returned." A cold draft swept through the room, extinguishing his bedside candle, leaving him engulfed in darkness and a chilling premonition of what awaited him the next day. What would Harry face now that the greatest evil had resurfaced?</p>

        <h2 class="h2a">The Hogwarts Express...</h2>
        <p class="p4">Bidding farewell to muggle world, young witches and wizards squeezed onto Platform 9¾, a hidden gem veiled by magic. Steam billowed from the scarlet Hogwarts Express, its whistle echoing anticipation. Butterflies flitted as they passed through the barrier, greeted by bustling compartments filled with chatter and laughter. Sorting hats perched on heads, they exchanged stories over cauldron cakes and pumpkin pasties, the rhythmic clickety-clack lulling them into a fantastical world. Landscapes blurred outside, replaced by fleeting glimpses of enchanted hills and quaint villages. As dusk settled, anticipation crackled. Finally, with a triumphant shriek, the train arrived at Hogsmeade Station, lanterns casting a warm glow. Greeted by Hagrid's booming laughter and escorted by magical boats across the moonlit lake, Hogwarts, a majestic silhouette against the night sky, welcomed them home.

        <p class="p5">
            Eleven-year-old Harry, ostracized and yearning for something more, clutched a worn letter: his ticket to a world he never knew existed. With Hagrid, a giant with a twinkle in his eye, he said goodbye to the oppressive normalcy of Privet Drive. Through a hidden barrier in a bustling London street, they vanished into Diagon Alley. A kaleidoscope of sights and sounds assaulted his senses: towering shops overflowing with wands, cauldrons, and fantastical creatures; witches in pointed hats gossiping over bubbling potions; the aroma of exotic spices and freshly baked pastries. Hagrid chuckled, his booming voice a comforting presence amidst the sensory overload. Harry, wide-eyed and breathless, felt a spark ignite within him. This wasn't just a shopping trip; it was a passport to a world where he belonged, a world woven with magic. He wasn't just Harry Potter anymore; he was a wizard, and Diagon Alley was just the beginning.
